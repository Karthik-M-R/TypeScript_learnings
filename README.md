# TypeScript Learning Repository

Welcome to my TypeScript learning repository! This repo contains my progress, code examples, and projects as I learn TypeScript.

## TypeScript Cheat Sheet

You will find a [TypeScript_Concepts.md](TypeScript_Concepts.md) file in the root of this repository. You can use it as a handy cheat sheet for important TypeScript concepts, types, and how TypeScript differs from JavaScript. It's great for quick reference and interview preparation!
